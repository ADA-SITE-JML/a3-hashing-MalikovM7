24 March: It is my first log, here I want to explain where I will write my code and what hashing technique I will use. I will write a console app on C# .NET 6.0, and will use SHA256 hashing function which is built in.

28 March: Created a console app and added User input readline in main method, to get n and s values which represent the number of buckets and the amount of records which the bucket can contain.

2 April: wrote main hash function method which computes a hash of the input string using SHA256 algorithm.

4th april: I have seen your comments in discussions, You asked to run the program with console arguments that is why I changed the part when I first was asking from user n and s values and added them directly from run configurations.
also I wrote a method for writing into the buckets , where I considered that comma ',' is dividing the strings
